CoreDataHelper
==============

A set of small classes that enable convenient setup of a new core data stack. I find these classes useful when starting a new Core Data based project.

## KMKManagedObject

`KMKManagedObject` contains helper class methods for quickly fetching and creating instances of the class.

## KMKManagedObjectContext

`KMKManagedObjectContext` contains helper class methods to quickly create contexts. It also contains instance methods to save the context and save all ancestor contexts, too.
